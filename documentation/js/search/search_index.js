                Angular change detection will be invoked for each of\nthe type, subject and group inputs. So we can anticipate\nthat this counter function will be called 3 times. Set\nthe bound filter array to an empty list when the function\nis called with the counter member variable at 0.  Reset\nthe counter member variable to 0 when the count reaches 3.\nIt would be nice to find a better way, but this appears to\nbe the only reliable option for responding to changes.\n\n\n

  \n\nCommons\n\n\nThe Commons is designed to publish information about digital projects and collections that are maintained within institutional repositories like DSpace, Contentdm, and Hydra or\n that exist independently as unique, standalone projects like Omeka exhibits and public websites. The Commons provides integration with \n repository services through shared authentication and authorization and targeted search capability.  \nThe project uses Angular, ngrx, and Angular Material.\nThe Angular-CLI and WebPack are used to develop, test, and build. The project is configured to support server-side rendering using \nAngular Universal with Node.js and Express.\nClient and server code is written in Typescript. \nThe Commons relies on the Tagger-2 public API for data.  The Commons is integrated with the dspace-client project for single sign on and automatic login. \n Passport middleware is used for CAS authentication. (Other authentication services can be used by installing and configuring the required Passport authentication strategy. See server/config/auth-config.ts). Authentication \n requires information provided in separate credentials.js files (described below). \n Redis is used as the session store and is required by the production environment.\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\n\n\n\nAngular\n6.1.4     \n\n\nAngular CLI\n6.1.4         \n\n\nngrx\n6.0.1     \n\n\nrxjs\n6.2.2     \n\n\nnodejs\n8.13.0\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nThe Commons is designed to use with the Tagger-2 REST API. You will need that project running with a production or development\nserver before starting.  \nFor server deployment you need to create two configuration files in your home directory (Mac or Windows): \n~/etc/commons-dev/credentials.js and ~/etc/commons-prod/credentials.js. Edit the files, providing the following information as appropriate for your development and production environments: \n'use strict';\n\nvar credentials = {\n\n  apiHost: 'your sever base url and port (if necessary).  e.g. http://localhost:3005',\n  serverBaseURL: 'the url expected by your CAS server, including port (this is not provided by the current CAS strategy implementation',\n  ssoBaseURL:' url of your CAS server',\n  validateURL: 'path to validation service',\n  domain: 'your domain, e.g. mycampus.edu',\n  redisPort: 6370 // unused in development, production only\n\n};\n\nmodule.exports = credentials;In the client, the Angular CLI is configured to recognize development, test and production environments and replace configuration files as needed. Use these files to configure the client application.\nDevelopment\nTo work on the Commons client without Universal server-side rendering, use npm run start:dev.  \nTo work with server-side rendering in development mode, use npm run build:development:ssr and npm run serve:ssr.\nTests\nFor unit tests, use npm run test.\nProduction\nTo build for production, use npm run build:development:ssr and copy the resulting ./dist directory to the production host.\nProduction Requirements\nSession management requires Redis for use as the session store. The redis port is configurable in credentials.js. \n(In development we rely on Passport sessions and therefore no session store is needed. But you might not be able to test\n authentication logic in Universal mode.)\nDocker\n(Needs update)\nAt the moment, the docker image is experimental and not used in our production setting. But here are a few things to know. \nTo use Docker, you will first need to install it on your machine.\nA DockerFile is included in the project. \nBefore working with Docker, be sure to first build the project with npm run build:prod.\nNext, to build a docker image from the latest production build, execute docker build -t /:latest ., substituting real values for the  and  placeholders shown here.\nYou can push this image to DockerHub (or elsewhere) if you have an account.\nTo pull the existing image from DockerHub, use docker pull mspalti/commons, or pull your own DockerHub image if you have one.\nIf all is proper, on the production host you should be able to start the container with this command: docker run -v /etc/commons-2.0:/etc/commons-2.0 -p 3000:3000. (Details may vary.) \nIt should be possible to preview the container on your development machine if you:\n\nInstall and run Tagger-2 on your local machine.\nModify the src/client/app/environments/environment.prod file accordingly.\nBuild the project with npm run build:prod\nBuild the docker image with docker build -t /:latest .\nStart the docker image with docker run -v /etc/commons:/etc/commons-2.0 -p 3000:3000 where  is your local home directory.\n\nFurther Help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
